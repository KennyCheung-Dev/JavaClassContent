		 * Notes:
		 * 
		 * Instance Variables/Methods vs Class Variables/Methods:
		 * 
		 * Instance variables/methods belongs only to a single instance,
		 * are only accessible when an object instance is created from the class
		 * 
		 * Class variables/methods belongs to the class,
		 * and does not require an instance of the class to be created
		 * 
		 * Class variables/methods are created by using the static keyword
		 * 
		 * Static methods CAN access static var/methods
		 * Static methods CANNOT access non-static var/methods
		 * Non-static methods CAN access non-static var/methods
		 * Non-static methods CAN access static var/methods

		 * Inheritance is a mechanism whereby a new class, called a subclass,

		/*
		 * Homework:
		 * 
		 * Create Bird and Dolphin classes
		 * Each class must have at least two fields that are present in all classes. 
		 * For example, age and name. 
		 * Each class must also have at least one method that are present in all classes. 
		 * For example, speak()
		 * 
		 * Each class should have at least one unique field and one unique method.
		 * 
		 * Make sure each class also has appropriate getters and setters.
		 * 
		 * Provide an AnimalCrossing class, act as main, where you create instances of other classes.
