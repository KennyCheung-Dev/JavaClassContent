		 * This program checks if a list of students can ride the roller-coaster
		 * However, this roller-coaster has a wacky set of rules before a student can ride the coaster. 
		 * A student can ride the roller coaster if these conditions are satisfied
		 * 
		 * 1. Have a ticket
		 * 2. The colour of their shirt must match the rides' shirt colour requirements. 
		 * 	  A ride may accept many colours, or just one
		 * 3. If it's a weekday, the ride will only permit students whose name start with a vowel.
		 * 	  If it's not a weekday, the ride will only permit students whose names start with a consonant.
		 * 
		 * Result: The program will then print out a list of all the students and whether they can ride the roller coaster.
		 * 
		 * You will prompt user with questions  to obtain information about:
		 * - Colour accepted
		 * - Is it a weekday?
		 * - How many and information about the students (names, tickets, shirt colour)
